# Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction-Model

## Project Overview:
A detailed analysis of applying data mining techniques in the airline industry to predict and enhance customer satisfaction. The objective is to leverage machine learning to understand factors influencing passenger satisfaction, thereby enabling targeted customer service improvements and retention strategies.

## Dataset and Methodology:
- **Dataset Details**: The analysis uses a dataset of 103,905 samples with 24 variables that capture a wide range of attributes related to passenger experiences, including demographics, travel specifics, and flight details like delays and service quality.
- **Methodology**: The project employs various machine learning algorithms, each suitable for handling the datasetâ€™s categorical and numerical nature:
  - Logistic Regression for binary outcomes based on passenger feedback.
  - Random Forest and AdaBoost for their robustness in handling complex, non-linear relationships and providing ensemble learning advantages.
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for leveraging similarity-based predictions.

## Predictive Model Performance:
- **Model Evaluation**: Each model is assessed based on precision, recall, and F1-score, highlighting their ability to predict 'satisfied' versus 'neutral or dissatisfied' passengers.
- **Top Performing Model**: The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, suggesting its suitability for deployment in real-world applications where predictive accuracy and reliability are crucial.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis:
- **Operational Impact Without Model**: Estimates of potential losses due to customer dissatisfaction and churn are provided, illustrating the high cost of inaction.
- **Benefits With Model Implementation**: The report calculates how predictive modeling can significantly reduce operational costs by accurately identifying dissatisfied customers and proactively addressing their concerns, thereby preventing churn.
- **Economic Evaluation**: Detailed financial analysis shows how the model can lead to substantial savings through more efficient customer satisfaction management strategies.

## Result:
Random Forest Classifier in predicting airline customer satisfaction is highlighted as a particularly effective approach. This model not only excels in performance metrics but also aligns with business objectives to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty. The report underscores the value of predictive analytics in operational settings and advocates for further integration of these technologies to improve the overall customer experience.
